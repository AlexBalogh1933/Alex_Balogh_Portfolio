                &emsp; For my Web Development class, our main project was to create a website for the class. I wanted to build a 
                website that I may use so I decided to create a Sims 4 Guide. It has multiple pages. Some are complete and some 
                that I am still working on. The ones that I have completed are Skills, Cheats, Challenges, and Easter Eggs. The 
                Careers/Jobs page is half complete. It is still missing a lot of the careers but the template for them is there.

                    This is the Cheats page. This page contains all of the cheats that you can use. At the top of this page is the 
                    guide to getting to the console to enter in cheats. Then each table is a different category of cheats. This 
                    specific image is of the Skills Cheats.

                    This is the Challenges page. This has a couple of the bigger challenges in this game. There are more out there 
                    but these were some of the more well-known ones. I plan to add more in the future. Each of them has a link to 
                    the page that has more rules fo the challenge if you want more information.
