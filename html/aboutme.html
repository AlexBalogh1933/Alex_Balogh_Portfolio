        <main id="About Me">
            <p class="normText">
                &emsp; Welcome, My name is Alex Balogh. I am a 5th year senior here at the University of Cincinnati. 
                My major is in Information Technology with 3 tracks; Game Development, Software Development, and Cybersecurity. 
                I grew up in Hilliard, Ohio which is to the left of Columbus, Ohio. I decided to go to the University of Cincinnati
                because I really liked the campus and the Co-op Program. I was entering college wanting to pursue Mechnical Engineering
                so I really liked the Co-op Program with the engineering school. During the second semester of engineering I decided that
                engineering was not for me and liked the more coding side of engineering so I decided to change my major to Information 
                Technology. The one thing that I was really happy about transfering is that IT also had the Co-op Program so I was not losing
                that when coming to IT. 
                <br><br>
                &emsp; I have loved video games and the process of them being made. One game that has stood out for me
                is Minecraft. I have been playing it since it was realesed back in 2010. It was the first game that I played. It
                turned me into a gamer. It is a game that I can always come back to and play something new. Minecraft was the main 
                reason why I can call my self a gamer. My dream is to create video games that create the next gerneration of gamers. 
                Minecraft was mine so I want to make games that bring so much join as I had when I first started playing Minecraft. 
                After a while I started gaining more games in my library. Now I play a wide varity of games but still play Minecraft
                whenever I can. It is still one of my favorite games. My favorite games are Minecraft, The Sims 4, Roblox, Ark: Survival
                Evolved, and Forza 5. I have so many other games that I love but those are the games I have been playing recently.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; I have designed a couple of games and made a couple custom worlds in Minecraft. Those are in the other tabs.
                I have 1 text based game I am working on called Gone. Then I started to create that text based game into a 2D top down
<<<<<<< HEAD
                game. I also have a couple game ideas that I am still working on behind the scenes and still planning. For the Minecraft 
                worlds/maps I have made a custom world that I am going to use as a map for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. The other 
                Minecraft map is a parkour course going through all the achievements in the game. Each level is based on the game achievement. 
                More information on these projects will be in other tabs.

                work. For the Minecraft worlds/maps I have made a custome world that I am going to use as a map for a Dungeons and

                &emsp; I have also created a couple webpages that I had a lot of fun creating. The first one was a Sims 4 guide with a bunch
                of infromation about the game and different things that are in the game. Random features, cheat codes, how to guides, and 
                many other items. That one was really fun creating and I even use it every so often to get help on things. I also have this
                website that I am working on. More information on these projects will be on other tabs.
