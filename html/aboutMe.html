                <!--Picture of me-->
                &emsp; Welcome, My name is Alex Balogh. I recently graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor of science 
                degree. My major is in Information Technology with 3 tracks; Game Development, Software Development, and Cybersecurity. 
                I grew up in Hilliard, Ohio which is to the west of Columbus, Ohio. I decided to go to the University of Cincinnati because 
                I really liked the campus and the Co-op Program.
                <br><br>
                <!--Reword or remove cause does it serve a purpose-->
                &emsp; I have loved video games and the process of them being made. One game that has stood out for me is Minecraft. 
                I have been playing it since it was released back in 2010. It was the first game that I played. It turned me into a
                gamer. It is a game that I can always come back to and play something new. Minecraft was the main reason why I can 
                call myself a gamer. <!--Focus if kept-->My dream is to create video games that create the next generation of gamers. Minecraft was mine 
                so I want to make games that bring so much join as I had when I first started playing Minecraft. After a while, I 
                started gaining more games in my library. Now I play a wide variety of games but still play Minecraft whenever I can. 
                It is still one of my favorite games. My favorite games are Minecraft, The Sims 4, Roblox, Ark: Survival Evolved, and 
                Forza 5. I have so many other games that I love but those are the games I have been playing recently.
                <br><br>
                <!--Add a little more to the games to then push them over to the other pages-->
                &emsp; I have designed a couple of games and made a couple of custom worlds in Minecraft. Those are in the other tabs. 
                I have 1 text-based game I am working on called Gone. Then I started to create that text-based game into a 2D top-down 
                game. I also have a couple of game ideas that I am still working on behind the scenes and still planning. For the Minecraft 
                worlds/maps, I have made a custom world that I am going to use as a map for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. The other 
                Minecraft map is a parkour course going through all the achievements in the game. Each level is based on the game achievement. 
                More information on these projects will be in other tabs. 
                <br><br>
                <!--Move to the above paragraph-->
                &emsp; I have also created a couple of web pages that I had a lot of fun creating. The first one was a Sims 4 guide with a bunch 
                of information about the game and different things that are in the game. Random features, cheat codes, how-to guides, and many 
                other items. That one was really fun creating and I even use it every so often to get help on things. I also have this website 
                that I am working on. More information on these projects will be on other tabs.  
                <!--Add other things outside of Tech. (Disc golf, Running, The worlds game-Football)-->
