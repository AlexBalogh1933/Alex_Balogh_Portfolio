                When I was trying to figure out how I wanted to set up my portfolio I decided I wanted to build a webpage 
                that has all my projects and other information. Building this site also gave me more experience working 
                with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I built this webpage using Visual Studio Code because it is an 
                application that I enjoy using and will continue using it for future projects. I also am using GitHub for 
                source control and to host the webpage on GitHub Pages. I enjoyed building this portfolio and getting everything 
                that I have worked on together and into one place. With building this site I have started to continue working on 
                my Sims 4 Guide since some of the pages are only half complete.

            <!--Explain why I built this page and how it shows me skills-->
            <!--What did I learn from this-->
